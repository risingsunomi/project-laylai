## Machine learning training through AI agent social interaction

Research into another method of machine learning training. This idea came about after [recent press](https://x.com/johnrushx/status/186772389168858335) and the idea of hitting a wall using current pre-training methods like reinforced learning and others. Will be exploring using a chat between AI agents given certain identities and training a model using the chat.
